# Lab 1 Git Race -- Project Report

## Description of Changes
[Detailed description of all changes made]
I have added two new features: the time-based greetings and the multilanguage-support. The time based make the application greet differently depending on the time of the day (eg. Good Morning, Pablo) instead of just typing "HellO". 

On the other hand, the multilanguage supports uses a different URL an API Endpoint to greet you using different messages.

These two interact between them, creating messages like "Bonsoir" or "Buenas tardes".
## Technical Decisions
[Explanation of technical choices made]
I decided to use the 'lang" method because it's the one I'm used to see on the Internet, after a concencious search on StackOverflow to check its viability.
## Learning Outcomes
[What you learned from this assignment]
I learned to use better Git terminal as I always use an IDE to make it faster.
## AI Disclosure
### AI Tools Used
- [List specific AI tools used]
Copilot.
### AI-Assisted Work
- [Describe what was generated with AI assistance]
The whole "skeleton" of the tests was made by AI, also some debugging in the main features.
- [Percentage of AI-assisted vs. original work]
30-70
- [Any modifications made to AI-generated code]
Yes, originally the tests didn't work and I had to change them, primarly I cutted some unnecessary tests.
### Original Work
- [Describe work done without AI assistance]
The main part of the features code, the whole documentation and all the repository stuff. 
- [Your understanding and learning process]
I had to restart this little project 5 times. First was on Windows, so it didn't match the standards required, second one on a WSL terminal - finished by the same reasons. So I installed an Ubuntu VM, that crashed after setting up a shared folder. I tried a fourth time on a Debian distro and the result was the same. There was a problem in the shared folder script, so I changed it from one made by myself instead of using a guide from another subject. I worked. But, I wasted a lot of time, generated me a lot of stress and probably some hair loss.
